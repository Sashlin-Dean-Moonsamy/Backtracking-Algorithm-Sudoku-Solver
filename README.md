Sudoku Solver
This is a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. The solver tries to fill the empty spaces of a Sudoku board based on the rules of Sudoku: each row, each column, and each 3x3 block must contain the digits 1 through 9 without repetition.

Introduction
The sudoku_solver function takes a partially filled Sudoku board as input and uses backtracking to find the solution. The function starts by finding the next empty block (represented by 0), guesses a number for it, and checks if the guess is valid. If valid, it proceeds to the next empty block. If no valid guesses are found, it backtracks and tries a different guess.

Functions
next_empty_block(board)
Finds the next empty block on the Sudoku board.

Parameters: board (a 2D list of integers representing the Sudoku grid)
Returns: A tuple (row, col) representing the coordinates of the next empty space (0), or (None, None) if there are no empty spaces left.
is_valid(board, guess, row, col)
Checks if a guess is valid at a given position on the board.

Parameters:
board: The Sudoku board.
guess: The number being guessed (between 1 and 9).
row: The row index of the guessed position.
col: The column index of the guessed position.
Returns: True if the guess is valid, False otherwise.
sudoku_solver(board)
Solves the Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

Parameters: board (a 2D list representing the Sudoku grid)
Returns: A solved Sudoku board if a solution exists, or a message stating "There is no solution to this table" if no solution is found.
Usage
To use the Sudoku solver, create a 9x9 grid where empty spaces are represented by 0, and pass it to the sudoku_solver function.
